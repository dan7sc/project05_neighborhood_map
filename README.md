# Neighborhood Map Project


### Project Overview

For this project, we will develop a single-page application featuring a map of a neighborhood. We will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify locations, a search function to discover these locations, and a listview to support browsing of all locations. We will implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (Foursquare address, photo or Flicker photo).
